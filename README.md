# Python Scanning Tool

A basic Python script developed to practice **network scanning and enumeration**.  
The script demonstrates how to discover open ports and services.

## Features
- Scans target host for open ports
- Identifies running services
- Simple CLI usage

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- socket / nmap libraries

Here, the user who is not registered on the site can upload any Word file and convert it to PDF, but there is a loophole in this page, which is that the attacker can exploit the ID to change it and see the file of another user who is not authorized to see it:

## Insecure Version (IDOR Vulnerability)

- When a user uploads a `.docx` file, it is converted to PDF and saved with a sequential numeric ID (e.g., `12`).
- The download link is generated as:


- **Problem:** There is no access control check.  
Any user can change the `id` parameter and download other users‚Äô files.

### Example
1. User uploads file ‚Üí gets link `/pdf?id=12`
2. Attacker tries `/pdf?id=11` ‚Üí successfully downloads another user‚Äôs PDF.
3. This is a classic **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** issue.


can change the ID to 9 and show file to aother user not supposed to be seen :

## Secure Version (Fixed Implementation)

- Access to `/convert_fix` requires login.
- Files are stored using **UUIDs** (Universally Unique Identifiers) instead of sequential IDs.
- Each file is **bound to the owner** in a secure map (`.owners.json`).
- When a user requests a file via `/pdf_fix?id=<uuid>`:
  - The system checks if the file exists.
  - Verifies that the current session `user_id` matches the owner.
  - Otherwise returns **403 Forbidden**.

### Security Benefits
- Prevents attackers from guessing file IDs.
- Ensures only the rightful owner can access the uploaded file.
- Mitigates **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** vulnerability.

The user logs in securely, uploads the file he wants, and it is converted securely without changing our ID value:

## Admin Dashboard (Scan Feature)

- **Run Scan (INSECURE):**
  - The system enumerates sequential IDs (1, 2, 3, ...).
  - Result shows multiple files accessible ‚Üí demonstrates **IDOR vulnerability**.
  - Example: `IDOR FOUND for IDs: 1, 2, 3, ...`.

- **Run Scan (SECURE):**
  - The system checks UUID-based files.
  - Each file is bound to its owner and requires authentication.
  - If an attacker tries to access it without permission, the server responds with **403 Forbidden**.
  - This confirms the **secure fix prevents IDOR**.

the result of scan the INSECURE page :

the result of scan the SECURE page :
üîí Even if an **admin** account tries to access files that do not belong to them,  
the system enforces strict ownership checks and returns **403 Forbidden**.  
This ensures full protection of user data and prevents unauthorized access.

## How to Run
```bash
python scanner.py <target-ip>
---

## Example Output
[*] Scanning target: 127.0.0.1
[+] Port 22 is OPEN (SSH)
[+] Port 80 is OPEN (HTTP)
[-] Port 443 is CLOSED


---

## Code Snippet

```python
import socket

def scan_port(host, port):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.settimeout(1)
    try:
        s.connect((host, port))
        print(f"[+] Port {port} is OPEN")
    except:
        pass
    s.close()
